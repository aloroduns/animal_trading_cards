        <p>Cat Description</p>
        <p id="para-2">The most common cat behaviours include purring, grooming, kneading and climbing. 
            But each cat will engage in these activities differently. Pay attention to your cat's behaviour and
        determine what is "normal" for your cat so you can be aware of unusual behaviour that may require a trip to the vet.</p>
        <p id="para-3">Once the cats get together, the mating process doesn't last very long - only about half of a minute to about 4 minutes.
            First, the male bites the female's neck, mounts her and positions himself on top of her. He then thrusts his pelvis into her and 
            finally penetrates her, which usually only lasts about 4 seconds.
